# WDI Project 2 - Sneaker Freaker

# Overview

Sneaker Freaker is a blog site for cool and trendy sneakers where users can upload their sneakers and post reviews about them.

it is mandatory to register and login to access to the blog content.

This is my second project from General Assembly's Web development course and was done in a week. It was my first project which involved using both front-end and back-end as well as fully RESTful routes. It was an individual project and made me understand the concept of incorporating data into web apps.

# Wins and Blockers

When I first started this project I didn't spend enough timing planning and ultimately had to take a step back and rethink my approach. After taking some time to properly map out what I needed to produce it was easy to brake the project into small manageable jobs. I tried to make sure that after each stage the code I had written was working correctly before moving on.

Adding the ability to show all of the reviews made by a user and the delete function to these comments was a major success for me. I'm really happy with the overall look of the site and pleased that it's also mobile responsive.

# Future Content
